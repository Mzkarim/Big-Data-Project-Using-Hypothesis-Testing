### Big-Data-Project-Using-Hypothesis-Testing

### Project 
Identify at least two research questions. Choosen two or more variables from the provided National 
Surveys of 8th Graders dataset, with which it is possible to answer the questions using a hypothesis test.
Essentially, we should pick at least two variables of interest, and we will be exploring the relationship 
between them. All analysis must be completed in SAS or SPSS.Then we should answer the research question 
developed using statistical methods we’ve learned and summarize our findings into a report. 

### About the dataset:
### National Surveys of 8th Graders 

A nationally representative sample of eighth-graders was first surveyed in the spring of 1988. A sample of these
respondents was then resurveyed through four follow-ups in 1990, 1992, 1994, and 2000. On the questionnaire,
students reported on a range of topics including: school, work, and home experiences; educational resources and
support; the role in education of their parents and peers; neighborhood characteristics; educational and 
occupational aspirations; and other student perceptions. 

The data.xls file contains 2000 records of students' responses to a variety of questions and at different points
in time. The codebook (Explanation of the data.pdf) explains the question and answer codes.
